                <p>The world is facing challenging times of crisis. Closed borders and travel bans, quarantine,
                 shortage of food supply, scary news, and much fear. Viruses don’t care about our status, money,
                  or fame, spreading from state officials to famous actors.

                Being a human right now is not easy. My thoughts are with those who lost a family member or a friend. I can’t imagine the pain of those battling mental or emotional illnesses during dramatic life changes. Some are struggling to put food on the table. Some lost their jobs. Some are alone and afraid.
                
                During turbulent times of stress, I feel worried, sad, and confused. Meanwhile, I show up every single day and do the best I can to help myself, my loved ones, and my community.
                
                I keep myself informed from reliable sources and stay away from negativity and drama. With all the toxic news imparted to us over TV and social media channels, it takes some inner work to keep ourselves balanced and calm.
                
                I know there are many things far beyond my control: earthquakes, tsunamis, the rain, the sunset, the stock market, political changes, economies that are going to collapse, this pandemic included.
                
                But there’s one thing I can surely self-manage, and that is my inner world: my actions, my thoughts, my emotions. The way I respond to whatever happens outside my inner space is totally up to me.
                
                There is much power in hope and faith. A positive mindset helps to boost our 
                immune system with serotonin, the feel-good hormone. Feeling good keeps us healthy!</p>
